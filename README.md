# ANNDL_Homework1
This homework concernsconcerns supervised image classi-
fication using Deep Learning techniques. 


Blood Cell Classification Project
Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution for classifying blood cell images into eight different types (including basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc.). The final model achieves 93% accuracy on the test set using EfficientNetV2S as a feature extractor

Dataset
13,759 RGB images (96x96 pixels)
8 different cell type classifications


Project Structure
The project includes multiple Jupyter notebooks:

Model implementation notebooks for each tested architecture
Dataset Manipulation notebook for preprocessing steps
Note: Dataset files (.npz) and model files (.keras) are not included due to storage limitations
