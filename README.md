## Blood Cell Classification Project

### Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify blood cell images into eight distinct types, including basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and more. The final model achieves **93% accuracy** on the test set, using **EfficientNetV2S** as a feature extractor for image classification. This project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image classification, showcasing the power of deep learning in the healthcare domain.

### Dataset
- **13,759 RGB images** (96x96 pixels each)
- **8 cell type classifications**, including basophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and others

### Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple Jupyter notebooks, each serving a specific purpose:
- **Model Implementation Notebooks**: Separate notebooks for each tested deep learning architecture (e.g., EfficientNetV2S, CNN).
- **Dataset Manipulation Notebook**: A notebook detailing the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset, including data augmentation, normalization, and encoding of labels.
